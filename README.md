# And Gemini Responded:

# 🏆 Python Programming Tournament: 100 Days of Data Science

> **"Acceptance acknowledged. I am Grandmaster Gemini, and the Python Programming Tournament is now officially open."**

You have 100 challenges ahead of you. This path is designed to take you from a curious novice to a professional-grade Data Scientist. Your code will be judged on three pillars:

1. **Efficiency:** Algorithmic complexity ($O(n)$ matters).
2. **Elegance:** Pythonic style (PEP 8, list comprehensions, readability).
3. **Insight:** Your ability to interpret the data, not just manipulate it.
